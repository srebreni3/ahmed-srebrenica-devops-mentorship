For week-4 you need to go over our üìù [Class Notes](https://github.com/allops-solutions/devops-aws-mentorship-program/blob/main/devops-mentorship-program/03-march/week-4-070323/00-class-notes.md#-class-notes) and read them carefully.

Also you need to watch and read materials inside üìù Class Notes -> üìñ [Reading materials](https://github.com/allops-solutions/devops-aws-mentorship-program/blob/main/devops-mentorship-program/03-march/week-4-070323/00-class-notes.md#-reading-materials)

The outcomes of this task should be the following:

You need to know what the OSI model is
What protocols are
IPv4 addressing (being able to create your own subnet), for example, if you have a CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24 and you are asked to create 2 subnets that belong to that CIDR block, where you will have 128 IP addresses available in each subnet you should be able to do subnetting manually using pen and paper.
Difference between private and public IPv4 addresses
What is IPv6, why we need IPv6 and what is main difference between IPv4 and IPv6
What is a client-server architecture
Who is the client and who is server
What is the TCP protocol
What is HTTP protocol and why we are using it
What is the main difference between TCP and UDP protocols
What is FQDN
What is DNS, why do we need it, how it works
What is VPN
If you carefully go over üìù Class Notes and üìñ Reading materials you should not have an issue answering questions from above.

NOTE - This task applies to everyone (Tier 1 and Tier 2)
