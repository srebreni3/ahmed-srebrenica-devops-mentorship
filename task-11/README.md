Hi,

Here you have two .md files, "GitFlow-installation" and "AWS-Cloudformation," where you can find the entire installation process flow for the Workshop.

The "screenshots" folder contains all the screenshots of this app, while the "gitflow-workshop-environment" folder represents the application environment.
