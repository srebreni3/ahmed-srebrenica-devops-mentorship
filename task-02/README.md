Create new branch called: `week-2-bandit-labs` from your current main branch.

Add new dir called `week-2` inside that dir you should create file called `bash-notes.md`.

File `bash-notes.md` should contain `minimum` all commands executed durring this task. Recomended is to add your own comments about each executed `command`.

For example:
`$ cat <file> - #koristimo za ispis sadrzaja fajla`

For actual task execution you need to do following:

- Access Wargames labs available on the following link: https://overthewire.org/wargames/ and on level Bandit solve tasks up to level 10
- After completing each level take screenshoot of your screen as a confirmation of successfully completed level

Once when you complete required levels create Pull Request where you will inside PR description attach screenshots with confirmation of completed levels.
Pull Request should contain `bash-notes.md` file with executed commands and screenshots.
