You need to create public GitHub repository inside your own GitHub account called: `firstname-lastname-devops-mentorship.`
You need to create `.gitignore` and `README.md` files and push those files to GitHub.

Please pay attention on the following:

Your repository should have two branches

- main
- development

Direct commits to main branch should be forbidden.

All changes needs to be pushed to `development` branch first and then you need to make Pull Request from `development` to `main` branch.

[ONLY TIER-1] Once when you do that post your pull request as a comment to this ticket for approval.

[ONLY TIER-1] Pull request will be approved from @allops-solutions/mentors group. Before sending Pull Request for review please add them as a collaborators to your GitHub project.
